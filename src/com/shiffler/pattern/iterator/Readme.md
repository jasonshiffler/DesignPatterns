This package is a demonstration of the iterator pattern. It allows a client of our different menus to iterate through
the items on the menu without having to understand the underlying data structures of the menu. 

Definition: The Iterator pattern allows traversal of the elements of an aggregate without exposing the underlying
implementation. It also places the task of traversal on the iterator object and not on the aggregate, which simplifies
the aggregate interface and implementation.
